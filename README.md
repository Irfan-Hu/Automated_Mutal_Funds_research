### 📊 Overview

**FundIntel AI** is an intelligent mutual fund research and recommendation system that leverages AI and automation to analyze, predict, and recommend top-performing mutual funds. The system is currently under development, with data integration and model training underway.

---

### 🎯 Objective

To automate mutual fund data analysis, performance prediction, and recommendation using AI and automation workflows.

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python  
* **Libraries & Frameworks:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask, Streamlit  
* **Automation Platform:** n8n  
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
* **Data Source:** Historical NAV & fund performance datasets (AMFI / Kaggle / AMFL)  

---

### 🚀 Key Features *(Work in Progress)*

* 🔁 **Automated Data Pipelines (In Progress):** Fetching and preprocessing data using n8n workflows.  
* 📈 **AI-Based Prediction (In Progress):** Training ML algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict mutual fund performance metrics like CAGR, risk, and volatility.  
* 💻 **Interactive Dashboard (Planned):** Streamlit / Flask dashboard for visualizing fund insights.  
* 📬 **Notifications (Planned):** Email/Telegram alerts post model updates.  
* 🧩 **Modular Architecture (Planned):** Designing a scalable system with separate ML, API, and frontend layers.
